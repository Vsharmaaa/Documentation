# API Quickstart

<!-- This document describes how to start using your API: authorization, authentication, accessing API resources. -->
In this section, you'll find a step-by-step guide to quickly start using the API.

## Prerequisites

* User Account and Authentication: Ensure you have a registered account with our recipe website to access the API.
* API Key: Obtain an API key, which is essential for making authorized API requests.

## Authentication

Securing Access:

* Application Registration: Registering into our application(system) to become a recognized user and access the app.
* API Key/Token Acquisition: Obtain a unique API key or token which acts as a passkey for accessing our API.
* Utilizing Key/Token: Including the key/token in the header of our API requests to authenticate and gain access.
## Making Your First Request
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: quickCookAPI.domain.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
Purpose: To retrieve basic information about the API.
Response :Returns the version(obtained from process.env.npm_package_version) and a JSON object with the API's name
("QuickCook API")  
```
GET /health-check HTTP/1.1
Host: quickCookAPI.domain.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
Returns the health of the api is it working,critical or down.
## Response Handling
Understanding API Responses:

* JSON-The API usually sends back information in a format called JSON. You'll need to read this JSON data to get the 
details you need.
* Errors-If there are any problems, like the API not responding or giving unexpected results, have a plan to deal 
with these issues.

## API Usage Tips
Rate Limiting to be setup to limit the misuse of requests (to be set to 50 per hour).

Usage of querying and filtering for the requests to obtain more specific data for retrieval of recipes and etc
## Next Steps
* Thoroughly testing each API functionâ€”such as collecting particular data sets or carrying out operations.
* Using these APIs(endpoints) to improve the functionality of your app, such as data accessibility or user experience adding more value to the users.
